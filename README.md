# project-euler
# This is a repository for storing my Project Euler solutions.
# I will be concentrating on both building my knowledge of
# programming, but also utilizing my knowledge of mathematics
# to make the algorithms run as efficiently as possible.
# So, for instance, the very first task involves adding
# multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000 together. Thsi could be done
# with a  for loop, but there is a simple formula many learn
# in highschool for the sum of the first n numbers which will
# provide a more efficient solution. I will use solutions like
# these as often as possible.

# I will also often do more than
# the problem actually asks for. This is for two reasons.
# The first reason is because I can and I want to. The second
# is because there are many cases when subsequent Project
# Euler problems will be more easily solved by utilizing
# code I wrote in greater generality than needed earlier.
# For instance, one problem requests the biggest prime
# number dividing a certain large number. Another problem
# asks for the nth prime for some big number n. It will be
# useful if I already have an algorithm coded to find a large
# list of primes up to a certain point.

# Finally, when possible and convenient I will write more than
# function which solves the problem.
